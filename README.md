# silent-mp3-datauri

[![stable](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/stable.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

A 15 millisecond silent MP3 file generated by Audacity, and exported as a datauri string. This can be used for detecting autoplay behaviour in browsers.

**Note:** The 15 ms duration was decided through testing on Samsung Galaxy S6, which was not capable of handling smaller files in `audioContext.decodeAudioData`. 

## Install

```sh
npm install silent-mp3-datauri --save
```

## Usage

The main export is a string, a datauri for the mp3.

```js
var silence = require('silent-mp3-datauri')

var audio = new Audio()
audio.addEventListener('canplay', () => {
  console.log("Can play!")
})
audio.src = silence
```
